ðŸš€ **Exciting Project: Handwritten Digit Classification with TensorFlow!** ðŸ§ 

I'm thrilled to share a deep learning project I recently worked on, where I classified handwritten digits from the **MNIST** dataset using **TensorFlow**! This project helped me explore neural networks, data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. Here's a brief overview of what I worked on:

### **Project Overview:**
- **Dataset**: The famous MNIST dataset containing 60,000 training images of handwritten digits (0-9) and 10,000 test images.
- **Preprocessing**: 
  - Loaded and scaled the dataset to normalize the pixel values.
  - Split the data into training, validation, and test sets.
- **Model Architecture**:
  - Created a **fully connected neural network** with hidden layers and **Dropout** for regularization.
  - Experimented with a more **complex architecture** by adding more hidden layers and increasing the layer size.
- **Results**: 
  - **Simple Model**: Achieved **98.01% accuracy** on the test data.
  - **Complex Model**: Achieved **97.85% accuracy**, showing that a simpler model can often perform just as well.
  
### **Key Takeaways:**
- Hands-on experience in building and training deep learning models.
- Understanding the importance of model complexity and regularization.
- Gained insights into **TensorFlow** and **Keras** for building neural networks.

# MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification using TensorFlow

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to use deep learning techniques to classify handwritten digits from the **MNIST dataset** using **TensorFlow**. The dataset contains 60,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9) for training and 10,000 images for testing. The goal is to train a neural network to predict the correct digit for a given image.

## Features:
- **Preprocessing**: Normalization of image pixel values, splitting of data into training, validation, and test sets.
- **Model Design**: 
  - A simple neural network with two hidden layers and dropout for regularization.
  - A more complex model with multiple hidden layers and increased layer size.
- **Optimizer & Loss Function**: 
  - Used **Adam optimizer** and **sparse categorical cross-entropy loss** to train the model.
- **Results**: Achieved an accuracy of **98.01%** on the test dataset using the simple model.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need the following Python packages:
- `tensorflow`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `tensorflow_datasets`

Install the necessary libraries using `pip`:
```
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib tensorflow_datasets
```

## Steps to Run:
1. **Download the MNIST Dataset**: The dataset is automatically loaded using `tensorflow_datasets`.
2. **Model Creation**: 
   - The model is a simple fully connected neural network with two hidden layers.
   - A more complex model is also implemented to compare results.
3. **Training**: The model is trained for 10 epochs using the Adam optimizer and cross-entropy loss function.
4. **Evaluation**: The model is evaluated on the test dataset to assess its performance.

## Training and Testing Results:
- **Simple Model Test Accuracy**: 98.01%
- **Complex Model Test Accuracy**: 97.85%

### Hosting the Project:

1. **GitHub**: If you want to share the code and results publicly, you can create a repository on **GitHub**. This way, you can provide a link to your project directly in your LinkedIn post and ensure that others can access the code, documentation, and any required files.

2. **Google Drive or Other Cloud Platforms**: If you don't want to host your project on GitHub, you can upload the files (such as the README, code, and trained model) to **Google Drive** or another cloud platform. Make sure the link to the folder is public so people can access it.
